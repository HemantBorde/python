PC/UVa IDs: 110401/10041, Popularity: A, Success rate: high Level: 1

The famous gangster Vito Deadstone is moving to New York. He has a very big
family there, all of them living on Lamafia Avenue. Since he will visit all his relatives
very often, he wants to find a house close to them.
Indeed, Vito wants to minimize the total distance to all of his relatives and has
blackmailed you to write a program that solves his problem.

Input

The input consists of several test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases.
For each test case you will be given the integer number of relatives r (0 < r < 500) and
the street numbers (also integers) s1, s2, . . . , si, . . . , sr where they live (0 < si < 30, 000).
Note that several relatives might live at the same street number.

Output

For each test case, your program must write the minimal sum of distances from the
optimal Vito’s house to each one of his relatives. The distance between two street
numbers si and sj is dij = |si − sj |.

Sample Input
2
2 2 4
3 2 4 6

Sample Output
2
4


Program : 

c=int(input("Enter no. of test cases : "))
for _ in range (0,c):
	rel=int(input("Enter no. of relatives : "))
	l=[]
	for i in range(0,rel):
		x=int(input())
		l.append(x)

	L=sorted(l)
	mid=max(L)-min(L)

	dist=0
	for j in L:
		dist+=abs(mid-j)

	print(int(dist))
